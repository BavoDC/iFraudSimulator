## Installation

### On current R (>= 3.0.0)
* Development version from Github:

```
library("devtools"); install_github("BavoDC/iFraudSimulator", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

(This requires `devtools` >= 1.6.1, and installs the "master" (development) branch.)
This approach builds the package from source, i.e. `make` and compilers must be installed on your system -- see the R FAQ for your operating system; you may also need to install dependencies manually.

## Documentation
The basic functionality of the package is explained and demonstrated in the vignette, which you can access using
```
vignette("iFraudSimulator")
```
.

The working paper is currently on hold on arXiv. As soon as this is resolved, the link to the arXiv paper will be added.
