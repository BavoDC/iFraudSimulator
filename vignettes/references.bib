abstract = {Insurance fraud occurs when policyholders file claims that are exaggerated or based on intentional damages. This contribution develops a fraud detection strategy by extracting insightful information from the social network of a claim. First, we construct a network by linking claims with all their involved parties, including the policyholders, brokers, experts, and garages. Next, we establish fraud as a social phenomenon in the network and use the BiRank algorithm with a fraud‐specific query vector to compute a fraud score for each claim. From the network, we extract features related to the fraud scores as well as the claims' neighborhood structure. Finally, we combine these network features with the claim‐specific features and build a supervised model with fraud in motor insurance as the target variable. Although we build a model for only motor insurance, the network includes claims from all available lines of business. Our results show that models with features derived from the network perform well when detecting fraud and even outperform the models using only the classical claim‐specific features. Combining network and claim‐specific features further improves the performance of supervised learning models to detect fraud. The resulting model flags highly suspicions claims that need to be further investigated. Our approach provides a guided and intelligent selection of claims and contributes to a more effective fraud investigation process.},

Early detection is a key factor in mitigating fraud damage, but it involves more specialized techniques than detecting fraud at the more advanced stages. This invaluable guide details both the theory and technical aspects of these techniques, and provides expert insight into streamlining implementation.

abstract = {Logistic regression is a widely used statistical method to relate a binary response variable to a set of explanatory variables and maximum likelihood is the most commonly used method for parameter estimation. A maximum-likelihood logistic regression (MLLR) model predicts the probability of the event from binary data defining the event. Currently, MLLR models are used in a myriad of fields including geosciences, natural hazard evaluation, medical diagnosis, homeland security, finance, and many others. In such applications, the empirical sample data often exhibit class imbalance, where one class is represented by a large number of events while the other is represented by only a few. In addition, the data also exhibit sampling bias, which occurs when there is a difference between the class distribution in the sample compared to the actual class distribution in the population. Previous studies have evaluated how class imbalance and sampling bias affect the predictive capability of asymptotic classification algorithms such as MLLR, yet no definitive conclusions have been reached. We hypothesize that the predictive capability of the model is related to the sampling bias associated with the data so that the MLLR model has perfect predictability when the data have no sampling bias. We test our hypotheses using two simulated datasets with class distributions that are 50:50 and 80:20, respectively. We construct a suite of controlled experiments by extracting multiple samples with varying class imbalance and sampling bias from the two simulated datasets and fitting MLLR models to each of these samples. The experiments suggest that it is important to develop a sample that has the same class distribution as the original population rather than ensuring that the classes are balanced. Furthermore, when sampling bias is reduced either by using over-sampling or under-sampling, both sampling techniques can improve the predictive capability of an MLLR model.

    abstract = "{Methods to correct class imbalance (imbalance between the frequency of outcome events and nonevents) are receiving increasing interest for developing prediction models. We examined the effect of imbalance correction on the performance of logistic regression models.Prediction models were developed using standard and penalized (ridge) logistic regression under 4 methods to address class imbalance: no correction, random undersampling, random oversampling, and SMOTE. Model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and classification. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we studied the impact of training set size, number of predictors, and the outcome event fraction. A case study on prediction modeling for ovarian cancer diagnosis is presented.The use of random undersampling, random oversampling, or SMOTE yielded poorly calibrated models: the probability to belong to the minority class was strongly overestimated. These methods did not result in higher areas under the ROC curve when compared with models developed without correction for class imbalance. Although imbalance correction improved the balance between sensitivity and specificity, similar results were obtained by shifting the probability threshold instead.Imbalance correction led to models with strong miscalibration without better ability to distinguish between patients with and without the outcome event. The inaccurate probability estimates reduce the clinical utility of the model, because decisions about treatment are ill-informed.Outcome imbalance is not a problem in itself, imbalance correction may even worsen model performance.}",

abstract = {In real-life credit scoring applications, the case in which the class of defaulters is under-represented in comparison with the class of non-defaulters is a very common situation, but it has still received little attention. The present paper investigates the suitability and performance of several resampling techniques when applied in conjunction with statistical and artificial intelligence prediction models over five real-world credit data sets, which have artificially been modified to derive different imbalance ratios (proportion of defaulters and non-defaulters examples). Experimental results demonstrate that the use of resampling methods consistently improves the performance given by the original imbalanced data. Besides, it is also important to note that in general, over-sampling techniques perform better than any under-sampling approach.},
